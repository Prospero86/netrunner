Granular control over incomming traffic like Policeman (more control than uMatrix in this particular subject).

Granular control over outgoing traffic like Tamper Data or like Privacy Settings (the addon).

Easy switch to preset profiles for both like uBlock Origin for incomming traffic and Privacy Settings for outgoing traffic.

Local cache like Decentraleyes and Load from Cache.

All this in a per site basis.
